## 🔧 How to Address Each Topic

### Data Structures

1. **Learn the Theory**
   - Understand what the data structure is
   - Know when to use it
   - Understand time/space complexity

2. **Implement from Scratch**
   - Use DATA_STRUCTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md as reference
   - Implement without looking at solutions first
   - Test with edge cases

3. **Practice Problems**
   - Solve 5-10 problems using each data structure
   - Focus on recognizing when to use it
   - Understand common patterns

### Algorithmic Patterns

1. **Study the Pattern**
   - Understand the core concept
   - Learn when to apply it
   - Study example problems

2. **Practice Recognition**
   - Identify patterns in problems
   - Practice pattern matching
   - Solve variations of the pattern

3. **Master Implementation**
   - Code the pattern multiple times
   - Understand edge cases
   - Optimize your solutions

### Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Read Carefully**
   - Understand the problem statement
   - Identify constraints
   - Clarify edge cases

2. **Think Before Coding**
   - Come up with approach first
   - Consider time/space complexity
   - Think about edge cases

3. **Code and Test**
   - Implement your solution
   - Test with examples
   - Handle edge cases

4. **Review and Optimize**
   - Analyze your solution
   - Look for optimizations
   - Study optimal solutions

## 💡 Best Practices

### Daily Practice Routine

1. **Morning (1-2 hours)**
   - Review previous day's problems
   - Study new concepts
   - Read through study guides

2. **Afternoon (2-3 hours)**
   - Solve new problems
   - Implement data structures
   - Practice patterns

3. **Evening (1 hour)**
