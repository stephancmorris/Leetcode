# ðŸŽ‰ Project Restructuring Complete!

Your LeetCode study project has been successfully restructured for FAANG interview preparation. Here's what has been accomplished:

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. **New Folder Structure Created**
- `01_Data_Structures/` - Foundation implementations
- `02_Algorithmic_Patterns/` - Common problem-solving patterns  
- `03_Blind_75/` - Essential 75 problems
- `04_LeetCode_150/` - Comprehensive problem set
- `05_Design_Patterns/` - Object-oriented design patterns
- `06_Practice_Problems/` - Additional practice space
- `07_Study_Guides/` - Comprehensive study materials

### 2. **Files Reorganized**
- âœ… All existing files moved to appropriate folders
- âœ… Problems renamed with proper numbering (e.g., `01_Two_Sum.py`)
- âœ… Syntax errors fixed (DFS.py typo corrected)

### 3. **Comprehensive Documentation Added**
- âœ… Main project README with study path
- âœ… Data structures guide with implementation templates
- âœ… Algorithmic patterns guide with recognition strategies
- âœ… Blind 75 complete problem list with study schedule
- âœ… LeetCode 150 structure and progress tracking
- âœ… FAANG study guide with 12-week plan
- âœ… Data structure implementation guide with code templates

### 4. **Study Materials Created**
- âœ… 12-week structured study plan
- âœ… Daily study schedules
- âœ… Progress tracking checklists
- âœ… Success metrics and timelines
- âœ… Interview tips and strategies

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start with Data Structures** - Review implementations in `01_Data_Structures/Basic/`
2. **Follow the Study Guide** - Use `07_Study_Guides/FAANG_STUDY_GUIDE.md`
3. **Track Progress** - Use the checklists in each README

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- Master all data structure implementations
- Practice basic algorithms
- Solve easy problems to build confidence

### Week 3-4: Patterns
- Learn algorithmic patterns
- Practice pattern recognition
- Solve medium problems

### Week 5-6: Blind 75
- Complete the essential 75 problems
- Focus on speed and accuracy
- Practice explaining solutions

### Week 7-10: LeetCode 150
- Comprehensive problem coverage
- Advanced algorithms
- Mock interviews

### Week 11-12: Final Prep
- System design preparation
- Behavioral interview practice
- Final review and mock interviews

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

By the end of your 12-week study plan, you should be able to:
- âœ… Solve Easy problems in < 15 minutes
- âœ… Solve Medium problems in < 25 minutes  
- âœ… Solve Hard problems in < 40 minutes
- âœ… Explain any solution clearly in 2 minutes
- âœ… Handle follow-up questions confidently
- âœ… Design basic systems for interviews

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Consistency is key** - Study daily, even if just for 1-2 hours
2. **Practice explaining** - Verbalize your thought process
3. **Time yourself** - Practice under interview conditions
4. **Review regularly** - Revisit solved problems weekly
5. **Mock interviews** - Practice with friends or online platforms
