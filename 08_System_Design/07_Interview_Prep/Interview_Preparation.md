- **Trade-off Analysis**: Understanding of design trade-offs
- **Scalability Thinking**: Ability to design for scale

## Step-by-Step Approach

### Step 1: Requirements Clarification
Ask clarifying questions about:
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system should do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, scalability, reliability
- **Scale Requirements**: Users, requests per second, data volume
- **Constraints**: Technology stack, budget, timeline

#### Example Questions:
- "How many users do we expect?"
- "What's the read/write ratio?"
- "What are the latency requirements?"
- "Do we need real-time features?"
- "What's the expected data growth rate?"

### Step 2: Capacity Estimation
Calculate approximate requirements:
- **Traffic Estimates**: Requests per second, concurrent users
- **Storage Requirements**: Data volume, growth rate
- **Bandwidth Requirements**: Data transfer needs
- **Memory Requirements**: Caching needs

#### Example Calculations:
```
Daily Active Users: 1M
Peak concurrent users: 100K
Requests per user per day: 100
Total daily requests: 1M × 100 = 100M
Requests per second: 100M / (24 × 3600) ≈ 1,200 RPS
Peak RPS (3x average): 3,600 RPS
```

### Step 3: High-Level Design
Design the overall system architecture:
- **Core Components**: Main services and their responsibilities
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system

- **Cache**: Fast data access
- **CDN**: Static content delivery

### Step 4: Detailed Design
Deep dive into specific components:
- **Database Schema**: Tables, indexes, relationships
- **API Endpoints**: Request/response formats
- **Caching Strategy**: What to cache, cache invalidation
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection

### Step 5: Scaling and Optimization
Address scalability challenges:
- **Bottlenecks**: Identify performance limiting factors
- **Scaling Strategies**: Horizontal vs vertical scaling
- **Optimization Techniques**: Caching, indexing, partitioning
- **Monitoring**: Metrics and alerting
