LeetCode 15. 3Sum
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Arrays & Hashing

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that 
i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1) excluding output
