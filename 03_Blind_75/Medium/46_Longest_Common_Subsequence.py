LeetCode 1143. Longest Common Subsequence
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Dynamic Programming

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. 
If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some 
characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

Time Complexity: O(m * n)
Space Complexity: O(m * n)
