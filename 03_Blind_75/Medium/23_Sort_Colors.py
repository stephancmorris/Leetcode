LeetCode 75. Sort Colors
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Two Pointers

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that 
objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
