LeetCode 155. Min Stack
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Stack

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
Implement the MinStack class:
- MinStack() initializes the stack object.
- void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
- void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
- int top() gets the top element of the stack.
- int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

Time Complexity: O(1) for all operations
Space Complexity: O(n)
