LeetCode 238. Product of Array Except Self
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Arrays & Hashing

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operator.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) excluding output array
