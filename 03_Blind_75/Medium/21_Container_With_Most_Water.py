LeetCode 11. Container With Most Water
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Two Pointers

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that 
the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
