LeetCode 74. Search a 2D Matrix
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Binary Search

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix. 
This matrix has the following properties:
- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Time Complexity: O(log(m * n))
Space Complexity: O(1)
