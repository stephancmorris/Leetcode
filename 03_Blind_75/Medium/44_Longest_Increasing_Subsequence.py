LeetCode 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Dynamic Programming

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements 
without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) or O(n log n) with binary search
Space Complexity: O(n)
