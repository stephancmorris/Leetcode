LeetCode 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Binary Search

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k 
(1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], 
nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed).
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of 
target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
