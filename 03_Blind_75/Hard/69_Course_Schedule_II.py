LeetCode 210. Course Schedule II
Difficulty: Hard
Category: Graphs

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. 
You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you 
must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid 
answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
