LeetCode 1235. Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling
Difficulty: Hard
Category: Dynamic Programming

We have n jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from startTime[i] to endTime[i], 
obtaining a profit of profit[i].
You're given the startTime, endTime and profit arrays, return the maximum profit you can 
take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.
If you choose a job that ends at time X you will be able to start another job that starts at time X.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
