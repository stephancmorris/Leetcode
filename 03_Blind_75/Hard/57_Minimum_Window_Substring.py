LeetCode 76. Minimum Window Substring
Difficulty: Hard
Category: Sliding Window

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring 
of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. 
If there is no such window, return the empty string "".
The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

Time Complexity: O(|s| + |t|)
Space Complexity: O(|s| + |t|)
