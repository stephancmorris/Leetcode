LeetCode 45. Jump Game II
Difficulty: Hard
Category: Arrays & Hashing

Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index 
of the array.
Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
