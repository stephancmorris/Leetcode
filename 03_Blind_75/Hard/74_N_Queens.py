Difficulty: Hard
Category: Backtracking

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no 
two queens attack each other.
Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return 
the answer in any order.
Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 
'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

Time Complexity: O(N!)
Space Complexity: O(N^2)
