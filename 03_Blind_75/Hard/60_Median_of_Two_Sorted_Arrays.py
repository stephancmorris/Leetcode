LeetCode 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Difficulty: Hard
Category: Binary Search

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of 
the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Time Complexity: O(log(min(m, n)))
Space Complexity: O(1)
