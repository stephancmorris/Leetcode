LeetCode 704. Binary Search
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Binary Search

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, 
write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. 
Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
