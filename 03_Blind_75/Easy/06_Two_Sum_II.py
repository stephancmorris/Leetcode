LeetCode 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Two Pointers

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, 
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be 
numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array 
[index1, index2] of length 2.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
