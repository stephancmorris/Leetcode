LeetCode 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Trees

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root 
node down to the farthest leaf node.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(h) where h is height of tree
