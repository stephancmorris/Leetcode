## üéØ Study Strategy

### Phase 1: First Pass (Week 1-2)
- Solve all problems once
- Focus on understanding the approach
- Don't worry about optimization yet
- Time yourself (aim for 30-45 minutes per problem)

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (Week 3)
- Group problems by pattern
- Identify common approaches
- Practice pattern templates
- Solve similar problems together

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 4)
- Re-solve all problems
- Focus on optimal solutions
- Practice edge cases
- Aim for 20-30 minutes per problem

### Phase 4: Mastery (Week 5-6)
- Solve problems without looking at solutions
- Practice explaining your approach
- Time yourself strictly (15-20 minutes)
- Focus on clean, bug-free code

## üìö Problem Tracking Template

For each problem, maintain:

```python
# Problem: [Problem Name]
# Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
# Pattern: [Algorithmic Pattern]
# Time Complexity: O(?)
# Space Complexity: O(?)

# Approach:
# 1. [Brief description]
# 2. [Key insights]
# 3. [Edge cases to consider]

def solution():
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Test Cases:
# Input: [example input]
# Output: [expected output]
# Explanation: [why this works]

# Follow-up Questions:
# - [Common variations]
# - [Optimization opportunities]
```

## üîç Common Interview Variations

Many Blind 75 problems have common variations:

- **Two Sum** ‚Üí Three Sum ‚Üí Four Sum
- **Valid Parentheses** ‚Üí Generate Parentheses ‚Üí Remove Invalid Parentheses
- **Maximum Subarray** ‚Üí Maximum Product Subarray ‚Üí Maximum Sum Circular Subarray
- **Binary Search** ‚Üí Search Insert Position ‚Üí Find First and Last Position

## üí° Success Metrics

- **Week 1**: Complete first pass of all problems
- **Week 2**: Understand all approaches and patterns
- **Week 3**: Can solve 80% of problems within 30 minutes
- **Week 4**: Can solve 90% of problems within 20 minutes
- **Week 5**: Can explain approach for any problem in 2 minutes
- **Week 6**: Ready for technical interviews

## üöÄ Pro Tips

1. **Don't memorize solutions** - Understand the patterns
2. **Practice explaining** - Verbalize your thought process
3. **Handle edge cases** - Empty inputs, single elements, duplicates
4. **Optimize iteratively** - Start with brute force, then optimize
5. **Time yourself** - Practice under interview conditions
6. **Review regularly** - Revisit solved problems weekly

## üìà Progress Tracking

Use this checklist to track your progress:

- [ ] Easy problems (15/15)
- [ ] Medium problems (35/35)
- [ ] Hard problems (25/25)
- [ ] Can solve any problem in < 20 minutes
- [ ] Can explain approach clearly
- [ ] Can handle follow-up questions
- [ ] Ready for technical interviews

Remember: The goal is not just to solve these problems, but to master the underlying patterns that will help you solve any similar problem in an interview setting.
