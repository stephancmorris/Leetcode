# Algorithmic Patterns - Problem-Solving Strategies

This folder contains common algorithmic patterns that appear in technical interviews. Master these patterns to solve 80% of coding problems efficiently.

## üìÅ Pattern Categories

### Arrays/
- **Two Sum variations** - Hash map + two pointers
- **Sliding window** - Fixed/variable window problems
- **Prefix sums** - Range sum queries
- **Dutch flag** - Three-way partitioning
- **Kadane's algorithm** - Maximum subarray

### Two_Pointers/
- **Opposite ends** - Palindrome, container with most water
- **Same direction** - Remove duplicates, merge arrays
- **Fast and slow** - Cycle detection, find middle

### Sliding_Window/
- **Fixed window** - Maximum sum of subarray of size K
- **Variable window** - Longest substring without repeating characters
- **At most/at least K** - Subarray count problems

### Graphs/
- **DFS/BFS** - Traversal and path finding
- **Topological sort** - Dependency resolution
- **Shortest path** - Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford
- **Union Find** - Connected components
- **Minimum spanning tree** - Kruskal, Prim

### Trees/
- **Tree traversal** - Preorder, inorder, postorder
- **Tree construction** - From arrays, from traversals
- **Tree validation** - BST validation, balanced tree
- **Path problems** - Root to leaf paths
- **LCA** - Lowest common ancestor

### Dynamic_Programming/
- **1D DP** - Fibonacci, climbing stairs
- **2D DP** - Edit distance, longest common subsequence
- **Knapsack** - 0/1 knapsack, unbounded knapsack
- **State machine** - Buy/sell stock variations
- **Interval DP** - Matrix chain multiplication

### Backtracking/
- **Permutations** - Generate all permutations
- **Combinations** - Generate all combinations
- **Subsets** - Generate all subsets
- **N-Queens** - Constraint satisfaction
- **Sudoku solver** - Constraint propagation

### Sorting/
- **Comparison sorts** - Quick sort, merge sort, heap sort
- **Non-comparison sorts** - Counting sort, radix sort
- **Custom sorting** - Sort by multiple criteria
- **Kth element** - Quick select algorithm

### Stacks_Queues/
- **Monotonic stack** - Next greater element
- **Expression evaluation** - Infix to postfix
- **Parentheses matching** - Valid parentheses
- **Min/Max stack** - Stack with O(1) min/max
- **Queue with stacks** - Implement queue using stacks

## üéØ Pattern Recognition Strategy

1. **Read the problem** - Understand what's being asked
2. **Identify constraints** - Time/space limits, input size
3. **Look for keywords** - "subarray", "substring", "path", "cycle"
4. **Match to pattern** - Which pattern fits this problem?
5. **Adapt the template** - Modify the pattern for this specific case
