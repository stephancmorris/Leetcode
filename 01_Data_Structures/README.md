# Data Structures - Foundation for FAANG Interviews

This folder contains implementations of essential data structures that form the foundation of algorithmic problem-solving.

## üìÅ Structure

### Basic/
Core data structures that every engineer must master:

- **Array/DynamicArray.py** - Dynamic array implementation
- **LinkedList.py** - Singly and doubly linked lists
- **Hashmap.py** - Hash table implementation
- **Stack.py** - Stack with LIFO operations
- **Queue.py** - Queue with FIFO operations
- **BinaryTree.py** - Binary tree implementation
- **BinarySearchTree.py** - BST with search, insert, delete
- **Graph.py** - Graph representation (adjacency list/matrix)
- **Heap.py** - Min/Max heap implementation
- **DFS.py** - Depth-first search algorithms
- **BFS.py** - Breadth-first search algorithms

### Advanced/
Complex data structures for advanced problems:

- **Trie.py** - Prefix tree for string operations
- **SegmentTree.py** - Range query data structure
- **FenwickTree.py** - Binary indexed tree
- **UnionFind.py** - Disjoint set union
- **SkipList.py** - Probabilistic data structure
- **RedBlackTree.py** - Self-balancing BST
- **AVLTree.py** - Height-balanced BST

## üéØ Learning Objectives

For each data structure, you should be able to:

1. **Implement from scratch** - Write clean, bug-free code
2. **Analyze complexity** - Time and space complexity for all operations
3. **Identify use cases** - When to use each data structure
4. **Handle edge cases** - Empty structures, single elements, duplicates
5. **Optimize operations** - Know when to use different implementations

## üìö Study Strategy

1. **Week 1**: Master Basic data structures
   - Implement each structure 2-3 times
   - Practice common operations
   - Solve 2-3 problems per structure

2. **Week 2**: Learn Advanced data structures
   - Focus on understanding the concepts
   - Implement simpler versions first
   - Practice with relevant problems

## üîç Common Interview Questions

- "Implement a stack using two queues"
- "Design a data structure that supports insert, delete, and getRandom in O(1)"
- "Implement LRU Cache"
- "Design a Trie data structure"

## üí° Pro Tips

- Always consider both time and space complexity
- Think about edge cases before coding
- Practice drawing diagrams for tree/graph structures
- Memorize the standard operations for each structure
