# LeetCode Study Guide - FAANG Interview Preparation

This repository is structured to help you systematically prepare for FAANG-level technical interviews. The organization follows a progressive learning path from fundamental data structures to advanced algorithmic patterns.

## ðŸ“š Study Path

### Phase 1: Master Data Structures (Weeks 1-2)
- **01_Data_Structures/Basic/**: Core data structures with implementations
- **01_Data_Structures/Advanced/**: Complex data structures and variations

### Phase 2: Learn Algorithmic Patterns (Weeks 3-4)
- **02_Algorithmic_Patterns/**: Common problem-solving patterns
- Practice each pattern with multiple problems

### Phase 3: Blind 75 Problems (Weeks 5-6)
- **03_Blind_75/**: The essential 75 problems every engineer should know
- Organized by difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard

### Phase 4: LeetCode 150 (Weeks 7-10)
- **04_LeetCode_150/**: Extended problem set for comprehensive preparation
- Covers all major algorithmic concepts

### Phase 5: Design Patterns & Advanced Topics (Weeks 11-12)
- **05_Design_Patterns/**: Object-oriented design patterns
- **06_Practice_Problems/**: Additional practice problems
- **07_Study_Guides/**: Interview tips and strategies

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Data Structures**: Master the implementations in `01_Data_Structures/`
2. **Learn Patterns**: Understand each algorithmic pattern in `02_Algorithmic_Patterns/`
3. **Practice Blind 75**: Solve all problems in `03_Blind_75/` (minimum 2-3 times each)
4. **Expand with LeetCode 150**: Complete `04_LeetCode_150/` for comprehensive coverage
5. **Review Design Patterns**: Study `05_Design_Patterns/` for system design interviews

## ðŸ“Š Progress Tracking

Each problem folder contains:
- Problem statement and examples
- Multiple solution approaches
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Common variations and follow-ups
- Interview tips and gotchas

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to a specific topic
cd 01_Data_Structures/Basic/

# Study a pattern
cd 02_Algorithmic_Patterns/Two_Pointers/

# Practice Blind 75
cd 03_Blind_75/Easy/
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics

- **Week 1-2**: Complete all data structure implementations
- **Week 3-4**: Master all algorithmic patterns
- **Week 5-6**: Solve Blind 75 problems (first pass)
- **Week 7-8**: Solve Blind 75 problems (second pass, focus on optimization)
- **Week 9-10**: Complete LeetCode 150 problems
- **Week 11-12**: Review, mock interviews, and system design

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

1. **Code by hand first** - Practice writing solutions without IDE assistance
2. **Explain your approach** - Verbalize your thought process
3. **Optimize iteratively** - Start with brute force, then optimize
4. **Time yourself** - Practice solving problems within 20-30 minutes
5. **Review regularly** - Revisit solved problems weekly

Good luck with your FAANG interview preparation! ðŸŽ‰
