## üìÇ Repository Structure

Solutions are primarily organized by the **algorithm topic** or **data structure** they utilize. This structure makes it easy to focus on specific areas of study.

| Folder | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Arrays** | Problems involving array manipulation and searching. |
| **Basics** | Fundamental problems, often used for introductory practice. |
| **Design Patterns** | Problems focusing on object-oriented and system design aspects. |
| **Graphs** | Problems using graph traversal (BFS/DFS) and related algorithms. |
| **Sliding Windows** | Solutions that use the Sliding Window technique for array/string problems. |
| **Sorting** | Solutions involving various sorting algorithms. |
| **Stacks** | Problems that leverage the Stack data structure. |
| **Two Pointers** | Solutions that use the Two Pointers technique. |
| **xBlind75** | Dedicated folder for solutions found on the popular **Blind 75** list. |

Each topic folder generally contains subfolders or files named after the specific LeetCode problem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Details

| Detail | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Main Languages Used** | **[List your main languages, e.g., Python, Java, C++]** |
| **Problem Source** | [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) |
| **Goal** | Efficient, well-commented, and robust solutions, organized by topic. |

## üîç How to Navigate

1.  **Select a Topic:** Choose a topic folder (like `Graphs` or `Two Pointers`) based on the type of problem you are interested in.
2.  **Find the Solution:** Inside the topic directory, you'll find the **solution file** (e.g., `Solution-Name.ext`).
3.  **Review the Code:** Each solution should have a detailed **docstring/comment block** explaining the approach, **Time Complexity** ($O(...)$), and **Space Complexity** ($O(...)$).
